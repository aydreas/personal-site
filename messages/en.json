In addition, Logigator has found its way into teaching materials and school books, supporting teachers in hands‑on instruction of digital logic. The combination of immediate feedback and a low barrier to entry makes it ideal for learning environments and self‑directed experimentation.",

		"introP1": "I operate a self‑hosted home infrastructure lab that closely resembles a small production environment. It is built around a Proxmox cluster with two nodes and an external QDevice to maintain quorum, running high‑availability virtual machines and containers with replication and automated failover. Network traffic for both home and virtualized workloads is handled by a virtualized OPNsense firewall, using VLAN‑based segmentation, policy‑based routing, and traffic shaping for isolation and control.",
		"introP2": "The storage backend manages over 400 TB of data using ZFS and LVM, including redundancy, caching layers, and cold spares. Data protection follows a 3‑2‑1 backup strategy with automated, encrypted offsite backups. The entire environment is monitored using Grafana and InfluxDB, providing metrics and alerts for critical failure conditions. Infrastructure provisioning is largely automated with Ansible and cloud‑init, and multiple Kubernetes clusters are used to run both private services and public‑facing workloads, like Logigator.",
